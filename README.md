# Library Management Backend (Spring Boot)

# Introduction
The Library Management Backend is a Spring Boot application that provides RESTful APIs for managing books and authors. It serves as the backend component of the Library Management system.


# Features:

Authentication: Librarians can securely log in and log out of the application.
Books Listing: Librarians can view a list of books in the library, including details such as titles, authors, and availability.
Add a Book: Librarians can add new books to the library, associating each book with a specific author.
Edit a Book: Librarians can update book details, such as titles and availability.
Authors Management: Authors' information is maintained in a separate database, and CRUD operations on authors are supported through RESTful APIs.
Database: The application utilizes a relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) to store information about books and authors.
Security: The backend includes security measures to protect the API endpoints, ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.
